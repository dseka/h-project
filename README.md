ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

I decided to put together this Web page with the objective to get familiar with shiny. I got inspired by the dashboard developed by JHU, 
https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medecine, https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/expert-opinion/coronavirus-outbreak-new-mapping-tool-lets-you-scroll-through-timeline. Most of this work got its idea from R studio's tutorial on shiny, https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/. 

This work is still evolving. I welcome suggestion and hint that improve the page.
